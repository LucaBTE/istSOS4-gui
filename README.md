# Introduction
## Synopsis
This project aims to develop a web-based administration interface for istSOS, making it easier to manage and monitor SensorThings API components. The interface will provide a user-friendly way to register, for example, new Sensors and Things, set metadata, and monitor sensor metrics such as received data, transmission delays, and overall system health.
## Benefits to the Community
<b>Simplified Sensor Management:</b> A user-friendly web UI to register, update, and manage SensorThings API components.\
<b>Real-Time Monitoring:</b> Insights into sensor performance, data reception, and transmission delays.\
<b>Enhanced Usability:</b> No need for complex API calls, making istSOS more accessible.

<b>Deliverables:</b>
- Web UI for managing istSOS SensorThings entities (sensors, things, etc.)
- Tools for metadata setup and system status monitoring
- Visual analytics on data reception, delays, and health
- Clear documentation and user guides

## Why This Matters?
Without this, managing istSOS SensorThings API components requires manual API interactions. This project will provide a more intuitive and efficient way to administer istSOS instances, making sensor registration and monitoring more accessible and user-friendly for a broader audience.
