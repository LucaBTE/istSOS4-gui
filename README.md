# Getting Started

To visualize the current version of the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js (LTS version)  
   Download and install Node.js (LTS so `npm` is included too):  
   https://nodejs.org/  

2. Clone the repository  
   Clone the project wherever you prefer by running:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/LucaBTE/istSOS4-gui.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the project folder  
   Move into the project directory and then into the `interface` folder:
   ```shell
   cd istSOS4-gui/interface
   ```

4. Check Node and npm installation  
   Make sure Node.js and npm are correctly installed by running:
   ```shell
   node -v  
   npm -v
   ```
   If both commands return a version number, you're good to go.

5. Install project dependencies  
   Inside the `/interface` folder, run:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
   

6. Start the development server  
   Launch the app locally by running:
   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

7. Open in browser  
   Once the server is running, open your browser and go to:  
   http://localhost:3000  
   You should now see the current state of the project.
